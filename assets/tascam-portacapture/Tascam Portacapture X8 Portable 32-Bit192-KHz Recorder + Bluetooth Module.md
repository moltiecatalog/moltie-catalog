⠀Innovative, powerful yet simple
Immediately after launching, the Portacapture X8's large colour touch screen displays the launcher, allowing you to easily select the best audio settings for your application. With these presets, you have more time to focus on the actual recording without having to deal with complicated settings.
However, if you prefer to set everything yourself, the MANUAL app offers you all the possibilities - including a recording guide that guides you through the required setting screens if desired.
## Six different recording apps to choose from
Manual This is the main app for multi-lane recording with up to six audio sources and a stereo mix (2 mix).
Voice: This recording app is ideal for recording interviews, dictations and meetings.
PODCAST: Use this app to create podcasts with up to four people.
Music: Choose this app for recording instrument and vocal pieces.
Field: Ideal for recording nature sounds outdoors.
ASMR: This recording app creates a visual effect on the display as a response to the input signal.
## Easy to adjust the levels
The Portacapture X8 offers a preset level setting that allows it to achieve a large dynamic range. High-quality dual A/D converters and recording technology with 32-bit flow point resolution are used. The result is the highest sound quality, even when recording at low level. When editing the audio data later, you can increase the level without deteriorating the signal-to-noise ratio (S/R). In addition, the internal normalization function can automatically balance the level of stereo mixing after recording.
By combining these features, you no longer have to use valuable creative time to find the right audio level for recording.
## USB audio interface for your computer
Thanks to its driverless plug-and-go functionality, the Portacapture X8 is a compact mixer with built-in microphones for live streaming via OBS or similar platforms and also allows direct recording of video comments and dialogues in DAW and editing software.
The Portacapture X8 streams up to eight tracks (six inputs plus stereo mix) via USB. By supporting the power delivery standard via USB Type-C, the device can simultaneously power any external microphone via the USB bus with phantom power. For video or audio conferencing, you can use the Portacapture X8 as a USB stereo microphone and record the sound at the same time.
## Premium large-format microphones
The Portacapture X8 comes with two high quality condenser microphones, each measuring 14.6mm in diameter - the largest microphones in our product range. As they are removable, both microphones can be attached to the device in both AB and XY positions.
AB arrangement: Ideal for achieving a wide stereo field.
XY arrangement: Provides ultra clear playback with reduced phase shift between both channels.
In conjunction with the dual A/D converter, 32-bit flow point processing and sampling rates of up to 192 kHz, these microphones simply capture everything from the quietest rustling to the loudest spectacle.
## Wireless remote control (with optional Bluetooth adapter)
With the optional Bluetooth adapter AK-BT1 and the Portacapture Control App, the Portacapture X8 can be remotely operated via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (iPad and Android devices).
In this way, you can record nature sounds in the wild without affecting the result by your own direct presence or your own noise.
## Multi-track recording with up to eight tracks
The Portacapture X8 can record up to eight audio tracks simultaneously (six single tracks + stereo mix). Select which inputs are recorded on which traces and apply noise gate, compression, EQ and reverb as you would do on a mixer.
With the MANUAL app, you can set levels and stereo positions for each of the six input tracks and create a stereo mix that you can publish as a podcast, vlog, song or other material.
The XLR/TRS inputs use the tascam know-how of the specially developed HDDA microphone preamplifiers (High Definition Discrete Architecture) that enable high-quality audio recording.
## Four XLR / TRS sockets plus inputs and outputs for your camera and other equipment
With four professional lockable XLR/TRS combo inputs for microphone and line signals, the Portacapture X8 is equipped for most of your daily recording needs. Connect your camera or other audio devices via an additional mini-jack input and output. When creating video material, you can record a pilot track with flap signals on your camera to simplify synchronisation when reprocessing the video material. Of course, there is also a headphone output that is so powerful that you can keep control even in noisy environments.
