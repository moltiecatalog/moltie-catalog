* A microphone for everything: recording studio, home studio, podcasts and streaming. World-famous singers: indoors, pod-casters: indoor and streamers: inside use the SM7B
* Voice and voice recordings in the studio: the dynamic capsule of the SM7B ensures a particularly transparent and natural reproduction of speech and vocals with its soft, linear and wide frequency response
* Podcasts and round radio - the air-sprung shock absorber and pop filter reduce the transmission of body sound and breathing noise - so that the voice is the centre of attention
* Content streaming - For professional live streaming you need a microphone that plays music and speech equally transparent and natural; the SM7B has been pioneering in this respect for decades
* Professional XLR connection – the XLR connection in combination with an audio interface allows more control over the sound – and thus an overall better sound quality
* Classic cardioid character for consistent recordings – the cardioid characteristic of the SM7B suppresses ambient noise so you can talk or sing in a comfortable position and the low colour sound is recorded just as you want
* Electromagnetic shielding – the innovative shielding keeps hum away from the shots thanks to computer monitors and other studio equipment
